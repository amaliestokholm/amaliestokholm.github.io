        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-can-i-improve-how-i-work&quot;&gt;How can I improve how I work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, I&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have done this kind of challenge a couple of times before, not always with good results. But I typically learn something and things go in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what I want to try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get up earlier
Since I move to Italy I have been living alone and many of my normal things that usually get me up early have not been working.
My boyfriend is not here to start the morning with, I do not feel safe going on morning runs in the parc (even though I love running in the morning) and an increasing feeling of angst and stress just makes me stay in bed for way longer than what is practical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to get up at 6. Have a quick shower, get dressed, grap my bag and get going with breakfast in hand. I have a 45 minute commute by foot and with a podcast it is actually okay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work I need to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to bed earlier. If I want 8 hours of sleep (and it takes me 30-60 minutes to go to sleep) this means I need to be in bed by between 21:00 and 21:30.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pack my lunch the evening before. This means that I at 20:30 the night before need to start packing a lunch and snacks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get an easier breakfast. Currently I have been drinking smoothies in the morning, but maybe I should switch this out to an oatmeal or a chia pudding to eat in the office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>A unified exploration of the chronology of the Galaxy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we delve into the complex structures of the Milky Way, leveraging recent advancements in data quality for a large number of stars.
Our aim is to use unsupervised methods to unravel the intricate components associated with the Galaxy’s formation and evolution.
We determine stellar properties for 21,076 red giants, spanning distances of 2–15 kiloparsecs from the Galactic center, establishing the most extensive sample of red giants with precisely measured asteroseismic ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By employing Gaussian mixture models as an unsupervised clustering technique, we explore the Galactic disc’s different stellar structures incorporating chemical, kinematic, and age-related data.
The outcome reveals four distinct physical components within the stellar disc: the thin disc, the thick disc, the stellar halo, and an interesting kinematically heated thin disc component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we identify a potential age asymmetry between the Northern and Southern hemispheres of the Galactic disc. We also quantify the vertical and radial age gradients of the Galactic disc by extending asteroseismic ages to greater distances than previous investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023MNRAS.524.1634S/abstract&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Read our entire study here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My academic iPad or how to link Zotero and Obsidian</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-academic-ipad--or-how-to-link-zotero-and-obsidian&quot;&gt;My academic iPad  or how to link Zotero and Obsidian&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one of the summer conferences, I noticed just how many people in the audience that would take their notes on an iPad during the talks. I wanted to try it out - here is my experience with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a refurbed iPad Pro as a birthday gift. I bough an Apple Pen, a Paperlike screen protector and a case for it (so I don’t break it too easily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I uninstalled most apps, changed the wallpaper, and installed my paper reference manager &lt;a href=&quot;https://zotero.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt;. And that is it. My idea is that this iPad is supposed to be a bit ‘dumb’ with few-to-no distractions and only a nice set-up just for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-zotero&quot;&gt;What is Zotero?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://zotero.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Zotero&lt;/a&gt; is a free and open-source reference manager you can use to manage bibliographic metadata and notes of research papers. From it, you can extract bibtex-entries or bibliographies of research papers rather easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Zotero has a decent built-in pdf viewer and annotator so you can take notes and highlight passages while reading the paper. This last part is what I want to use it for on my academic iPad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-obsidian&quot;&gt;What is Obsidian?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I also want to easily get an overview of all of my notes on a single paper. For this I use a workflow that connects Zotero with my note-taking app &lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and saves my notes in a readable, searchable, nice-looking markdown file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in my post on &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/08/22/my-Obsidian/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app that saves all of your notes in plain markdown files in a local folder. It is a free tool and because it stores the data locally in simple text files, you do not rely on a cloud-service or on keep using Obsidian for the rest of your working life. The notes will always be readable to you and you can always access them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it as a repository for notes, ideas, code snippets, and lists, but there are many different ways of using it. One strength of Obsidian is the many community-driven plug-ins that adds amazing functionalities and customizations so you can design the workflow that best suits you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;devices-and-workflow&quot;&gt;Devices and workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have Zotero and Obsidian on both my work laptop and my personal laptop. The laptops synchronize the Obsidian Vault using git and the Obsidian plug-in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Obsidian Git&lt;/a&gt;. This then also works as a backup for all of my notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the pdf’s and notes in Zotero, I use the build-in Zotero Sync. This choice makes it possible for me to synchronize with the IOS app on my iPad and therefore use it for taking notes and reading. You get up to 300 MB for free and can update to more for relatively cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the workflow is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;when I find a paper on one of the laptops, I use the chrome extention of Zotero to add the pdf to my Zotero library.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I then read it, highlight it, and take notes in it on my iPad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With two clicks in Zotero, a nicely formatted text with all my notes on this specific paper pops up inside my Obsidian Vault for easy accessing and use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-i-take-notes-on-the-academic-ipad&quot;&gt;How I take notes on the academic iPad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now there is only 5 colours in the built-in Zotero Annotator. I use them for marking different things in a research paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Yellow &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#ffd400&lt;/code&gt; are default highlights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Red  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#ff6666&lt;/code&gt;  are things that I disagree with the author of the paper on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Green &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#5fb236&lt;/code&gt; marks tasks such as references I want to follow up and read or tests I want to do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blue &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#2ea8e5&lt;/code&gt; highlights things that confuse me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purple &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#a28ae5&lt;/code&gt; are important conclusions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides highlighting text in the paper, I will take general notes in sticky notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these highlights and notes will be saved, converted to markdown files, and become part of my Obsidian Vault. Here they get tagged and formatted based on their colours and nature, meaning I get a single nice-looking markdown file with all of my notes and references for every single paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes them easily searchable and usable with the great backlinking system in Obsidian and its network view of notes. For me, this actually makes them a lot more useful. Back when I had a more physical, non-electronic system, I rarely went through my notes from paper reviews or conferences – but this new system has changed that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Apple pencil, I can write my notes and get the handwriting converted into text using the brilliant &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208459#:~:text=Turn%20handwriting%20into%20text%20with%20Scribble&amp;amp;text=In%20a%20document%2C%20tap%20Apple,the%20screen%2C%20then%20start%20writing.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Scribble function&lt;/a&gt;, which is enabled in newer versions of iPad IOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the Apple Pencil I can also draw in the paper on Zotero, however, these drawings do not get converted and saved in Obsidian. I therefore usually accompany a drawing with a sticky note (that does make it into my Obsidian Vault) so I remember that the drawing exists and can look it up if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;more-technical-linking-obsidian-and-zotero&quot;&gt;More technical: Linking Obsidian and Zotero&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you actually link Obsidian to Zotero in order to extract your notes in a nice way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started out with the workflow outlined &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-zotfile-mdnotes-obsidian-dataview-workflow/15536&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Here you download Obsidian and the plug-ins Better Bibtex, Zotfile, and Mdnotes and you change some of the default settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I want to connect Zotero with my iPad, I did not make the set-up with a shared folder. Instead I enabled Zotero Sync. Otherwise, I followed the guide all the way to section 3.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zotero had been updated from version 5 to 6 since the tutorial was posted and this basically broke section 3.2 which concerns a set-up using Zotfile to extract annotations from Zotero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Zotero 6 has many of the same functionalities as Zotfile (see e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jlegewie/zotfile/pull/573&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;). Here is my version of section 3.2 (which I also posted &lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-zotfile-mdnotes-obsidian-dataview-workflow/15536/101?u=cassiopyas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;as a reply in the thread&lt;/a&gt;)):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;extraction-of-notes&quot;&gt;Extraction of Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have added your notes to a paper in Zotero 6 using their annotator, you can create a note with all annotations in the PDF by right-clicking on the parent item in the items list and select &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Add Note from Annotations&lt;/code&gt;. (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader#adding_annotations_to_notes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this you can right-click on the parent item in the items list and select &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mdnotes -&amp;gt; Create full export note&lt;/code&gt; to get the formatted output in Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Create full export note&lt;/code&gt; menu exports an item’s metadata and its Zotero notes as a single file. For that it uses the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mdnotes Default Template.md&lt;/code&gt;, which you should edit by adding your desired metadata placeholders like done in this tutorial. Zotero notes included in this export will use a new template you need to add to the same root directory as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mdnotes Default Template.md&lt;/code&gt; called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Zotero Note Template.md&lt;/code&gt;. My &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Zotero Note Template.md&lt;/code&gt; only contains one line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{noteContent}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;formatting-the-extraction-of-notes&quot;&gt;Formatting the extraction of notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customizing of annotations can be done using note templates in the Config Editor in Zotero, like in Section 3.1. A brief link on how the Config Editor customization works can be found &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.zotero.org/support/note_templates&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; . Now you need to change&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates.title&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates.note&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates.highlight&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;322-changing-the-note-title&quot;&gt;3.2.2 Changing the Note Title&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zotero’s Config Editor, you need to change the setting  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates.title&lt;/code&gt; to change the title of the Extracted note. The default is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h1&amp;gt;{{title}}&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;({{date}})&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; but as I am not interested in keeping the date, I changed it to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;{{title}}&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;323-editing-the-annotated-comments&quot;&gt;3.2.3 Editing the Annotated Comments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to highlight my annotated comments from parts of the main text that are highlighted. However, Mdnotes does not yet support italics or bold (In the (&lt;a href=&quot;https://argentinaos.com/zotero-mdnotes/changelog/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Changelog&lt;/a&gt;) this feature is listed under “Unreleased”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Zotero’s Config Editor, you need to change the setting  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates.note&lt;/code&gt; to change the behavior of Notes/Sticky Notes
So for now I have changed it to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Note]] {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; {{if tags}} &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tags:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; #{{tags join=&apos; #&apos;}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{{endif}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line by line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Note]] {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds the link Note to this comment and tells me where in the document I added this sticky note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds my own note as a blockquote to separate it from the rest of the main text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{if tags}} &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tags:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; #{{tags join=&apos; #&apos;}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{{endif}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds another blockquote with any tags given to this note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;324-changing-underlines&quot;&gt;3.2.4 Changing Underlines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I could not find the setting for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;325-highlight-colors&quot;&gt;3.2.5 Highlight Colors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Zotero’s Config Editor, you need to change the setting  &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;extensions.zotero.annotations.noteTemplates.highlight&lt;/code&gt; to change the behavior of the highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit more limited than before as there as of now only are 5 colours in Zotero Annotator : yellow: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#ffd400&lt;/code&gt;, red: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#ff6666&lt;/code&gt;, green: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#5fb236&lt;/code&gt;, blue: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#2ea8e5&lt;/code&gt;, purple: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#a28ae5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, my highlighting system currently is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;yellow is a default highlight&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;red is notes I disagree with the authors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;green marks interesting follow-up material&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;blue highlights things that confuse me, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;purple highlights are important conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now I have changed the setting to this long bit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{if comment}} {{if color == &apos;#ffd400&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; {{elseif color == &apos;#5fb236&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; - [ ] {{comment}} #task&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; {{elseif color == &apos;#ff6666&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Disagreement]]: {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; {{elseif color == &apos;#2ea8e5&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Confusion]]: {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; {{elseif color == &apos;#a28ae5&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Important]]: {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt; {{else}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{{endif}} {{if tags}} &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tags:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; #{{tags join=&apos; #&apos;}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{{endif}} {{else}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Highlight]]:{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;{{endif}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again let us go through it line by line:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{if comment}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a text comment was added to the highlight, do some of the following&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{if color == &apos;#ffd400&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the color is yellow, just add a blockquote note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{elseif color == &apos;#5fb236&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt; - [ ] {{comment}} #task&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the color is green, add a to-do item with the comment and tag the item with the label &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#task&lt;/code&gt;. This makes it possible to do the neat Dataview extraction in Obsidian as explained at the end of tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{elseif color == &apos;#ff6666&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Disagreement]]: {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the color is red, mark the comment as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Disagreement&lt;/code&gt; and add the note in a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{elseif color == &apos;#2ea8e5&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Confusion]]: {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the color is blue, mark the comment as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Confusion&lt;/code&gt; and add the note in a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{elseif color == &apos;#a28ae5&apos;}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Important]]: {{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the color is purple, label the comment as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Important&lt;/code&gt; and add the note in a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{else}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;{{comment}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{{endif}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the color is something else (not yet implemented), then just add the note in a blockquote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{if tags}} &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Tags:&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; #{{tags join=&apos; #&apos;}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;{{endif}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All tags added in Zotero are added to a list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{{else}}&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;[[Highlight]]:{{highlight quotes=&apos;true&apos;}} {{citation}}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;{{endif}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the highlight contains no notes, mark it as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Highlight&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;workflow&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the workflow becomes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the pdf in Zotero via a browser.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the paper in Zotero on the iPad and add notes and highlights to it,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right-click paper and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Add Note from Annotations&lt;/code&gt; on a laptop,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right-click paper and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mdnotes -&amp;gt; Create full export note&lt;/code&gt; on a laptop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open your Obsidian Vault and hurrah – the file with all the metadata and your notes is now there!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>My Obsidian Vault</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-obsidian-vault&quot;&gt;My Obsidian Vault&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://obsidian.md&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is a note-taking and knowledge management app. What I like about it is that it saves all of your notes in markdown files in a local folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a free tool and because it stores the data locally in plain text files, you do not rely on a cloud-service or on keep using Obsidian for the rest of your working life. You can easily migrate your notes from these simple markdown files to something else if you prefer and they do not get lost or locked behind a paywall if the service stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use it as a repository for notes, ideas, code snippets, and lists, but there are many different ways of using it. One strength of Obsidian is the many community-driven plug-ins that adds amazing functionalities and customizations so you can design the workflow that suits you the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freedom of Obsidian is one of the things I really appreciate about it. I have one single Obsidian workspace or so-called Obsidian Vault. Some people like to have multiple for different projects or for a separation between personal/work notes. I just like my single everything-goes-here system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can easily change how Obsidian looks and behaves via the plug-ins. Currently, I am loving the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Yin-and-Yang-Theme&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Yin Yang theme&lt;/a&gt; in light-mode(!) with an accent colour in a slightly darker purple (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#DAAFFF&lt;/code&gt;) than default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t keep a strict structure to my Obsidian Vault. Whenever I feel like writing something down, I just open a new note and start writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently I do have a vague structure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subdirectory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;daily&lt;/code&gt; contains my daily notes in Obsidian. If you look up almost any guide on how to use Obsidian, daily notes are usually an essential part. It can be a journey entry, a daily to-do list or whatever you prefer. My current template for daily notes is &lt;a href=&quot;https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;this template from Dann Berg&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subdirectory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Academia&lt;/code&gt; contains meta-level notes about my work. Here I can find the text snippets with the standard formatting of my affiliations and acknowledgement that I need to put into every paper I write along with some general notes on workflow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subdirectory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Personal&lt;/code&gt; contains notes for my personal life. Right now this contains an unfinished list of all my subscription software and apps so I know what to keep and what to cancel.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subdirectory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reading&lt;/code&gt; contains notes for research papers I have read and that is linked to my Zotero.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subdirectory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Students&lt;/code&gt; contains a note for each student I supervise or co-supervise. This contains when they have to hand-in, outlines of their projects and meeting notes and agreements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Subdirectory &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;templates&lt;/code&gt; contains all my Obsidian templates and is rarely opened from within Obsidian. However, it is nice to access them easily and to have them in the same git repository as the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;And lastly, notes that just ‘floats’ on the top-level. These might be short and have no other place to be and that is okay. Not everything needs to live inside a subdirectory. Sometimes if these notes grow in size or if they become to specific I choose to move them or merge them with other notes. Other times, they just stay where they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Low-cost first steps to improve equality in a workspace</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;low-cost-first-steps-to-improve-equality-in-a-workspace&quot;&gt;Low-cost first steps to improve equality in a workspace&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equality is many things, but essentially equality is about ensuring that every individual has an equal opportunity and is treated fairly. No one should have poorer life chances because of what they were born with, where they come from, or what they believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equality in the workplace ensures that people are given equal opportunities and equal pay regardless of gender, nationality, ethnic/cultural/social origin, religion, ideology, age, sexual orientation, disabilities, gender expression or identity. Everyone deserves to get the same respect and to have the same opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advancing equal opportunity is both morally right and benefits
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/how-advancing-womens-equality-can-add-12-trillion-to-global-growth&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;society&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://eige.europa.eu/gender-mainstreaming/policy-areas/economic-and-financial-affairs/economic-benefits-gender-equality&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;as&lt;/a&gt;
a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://equitablegrowth.org/the-economic-benefits-of-equal-opportunity-in-the-united-states-by-ending-racial-ethnic-and-gender-disparities/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;whole&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many initiatives that have been shown to be efficient at improving equality.
Initiatives such as fair wages, better hiring/application practices, and parental leave, to name a few, are of the utmost importance, and they must be addressed and implemented to secure a better and more equal workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these initiatives, however, are a bit &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; in terms of person-hours, time, and money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I have compiled a list of inexpensive things that, in many cases, can be decided upon and implemented with fewer resources than the more expensive initiatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In academia, these can more-or-less be implemented at the departmental level, and fewer people need to be involved when deciding whether to implement them.
They can help start the discussion of improving the balance between different people at the workspace and improve the work environment in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I welcome any suggestions and comments to this list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-an-ombudsperson&quot;&gt;Get an ombudsperson&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;ombuds&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appoint an official ombudsperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, one of the most efficient ways of combating harassment is to appoint an &lt;em&gt;ombudsperson&lt;/em&gt;.
An ombudsperson is a neutral and informal person who any worker can approach and ask for help or advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Charles L. Howard brilliantly summarises it in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://hbr.org/2020/05/what-happens-when-an-employee-calls-the-ombudsman&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;em&gt;Ombudsmen exist for one simple reason: to help people and organisations. They help employees by providing an individual (or a team) with whom to have confidential conversations, whether about someone who is taking bribes, a supervisor who’s using drugs, sexual harassment, a personal conflict, or some other issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibilities of the ombudsperson can be designed to fit the individual workspace.
Consider for example if it would make sense to even have more than one ombudsperson-like person at your organisation or to separate different types of inquiries to different people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example I have from academia is how the role of ombudsperson was designed at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mpia.de/en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Max Planck Institute for Astronomy&lt;/a&gt; (MPIA) when I was a visiting researcher in beginning of 2020.
Their ombudsperson is a neutral, informal role with whom to have confidential conversations with, however, they had also specified that their ombudsperson is a &lt;em&gt;science&lt;/em&gt; ombudsperson. This specification meant that their science ombudsperson is mainly in charge of confidential advice with regards to suspicion of scientific misconduct or other violations of the principles of good scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, MPIA also had four so-called &lt;em&gt;conflict coaches&lt;/em&gt;. Their roles were to help and advise in situations of personal conflicts at the workplace. These conflict coaches were at different levels of seniority, meaning that they were approachable for most people in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This separation of different areas might not be applicable or the best choice for your organisation – there exists many excellent ways of having an ombudsperson-like system. For smaller institutes or organisations, one ombudsperson might be sufficient, while for larger workplaces multiple ombudspersons might need to be appointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is to formalise what an ombudsperson can do. That the ombudsperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;must treat in confidence any information brought to their attention.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is not obligated to disclose this information to the management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;can initiate meetings between the person suspected of misconduct or the management.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;has the means to refer a worker to professional or legal help if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;formalise-the-first-step&quot;&gt;Formalise the first step&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;formalise&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have clear procedures for bad scenarios before they happen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in academia, ask yourself if you would know what to do if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;you are bullied / harassed / sexually assaulted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your close colleague is bullied / harassed / sexually assaulted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your student is bullied / harassed / sexually assaulted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a first-year student with no wide network at the institute is bullied / harassed / sexually assaulted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chances are that you cannot answer these questions because your workplace has no clear policy of what to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One important thing is to formalise exactly how to report when something bad has happened at your workspace.
For the most severe cases, the police need to get involved, but in many of these cases these reports just need to be handled internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not necessary to have a full, detailed flowchart of what to do in all cases: many cases are unique and require individual care.
However, the first couple of steps need to be formalised so that people know who to talk to and what actions to take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been surprised by how few of these procedures have been in place – even at big workplaces – and how poorly they have been implemented.
Or at least how procedures can be designed to keep the company safe by just shutting up/ignoring employees (or students) in need instead of helping them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;#MeToo&lt;/em&gt; movement, I have noticed that more procedures have been formalised in the case of sexual harassment, but that is not the case everywhere (and the implementation is not necessarily &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt;) so please check what the situation is at your current workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the who-to-contact information, also have &lt;em&gt;the support&lt;/em&gt; for a victim in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of academia: if a student is harassed by a staff member, HR will most likely help the staff member, but who will be the support of the student? Does your university have a connection to a law firm to contact in order to obtain legal support for internal matters? Or is there another designated neutral party who can act as a helper/lawyer/simple-help-to-remember-how-meetings-went-and-what-was-discussed for the student?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing to consider is: Who acts as a &lt;em&gt;judge&lt;/em&gt; in these internal conflicts?&lt;br /&gt;
By design, would the &lt;em&gt;judge&lt;/em&gt; have any reason to not be impartial and neutral?
For instance, is it the case that the appointed judge is the immediate supervisor of one of the parties?
In that case: would it be possible to change the current system so that it is a requirement that the judge(s) should not know or have worked with any of the parties beforehand?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is difficult to formulate and I know this might be one of the most “expensive” items on this list of first steps.
But starting the discussion is an important first step, even if it is difficult to visualise the final version of these new procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;-and-let-everyone-know&quot;&gt;… and let everyone know&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;inform&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inform people that procedures are in place and what they are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working procedures do very little if nobody knows they are in place, so make the very first step of &lt;em&gt;who to contact&lt;/em&gt; clear and public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could be by adding it to internal web pages, bulletin boards, welcome-to-the-workplace email, newsletters,  – you name it. Just make sure it reaches everyone in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best example I have seen of this is what they did at MPIA, which I noticed during my research stay there in 2020:
On the inside of all toilet stalls in the building is a laminated, printed sign titled &lt;em&gt;Help in conflict situations&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;is written in &lt;a href=&quot;#bilingual&quot;&gt;both English and German&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contains a link to &lt;a href=&quot;#coc&quot;&gt;their Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;contains QR-codes to &lt;a href=&quot;#inform&quot;&gt;the relevant pages on their webpages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;most importantly: a green box of who to contact if you need help. This includes their &lt;a href=&quot;#ombuds&quot;&gt;ombudsperson&lt;/a&gt; who is responsible for topics related to scientific malpractice as well as their so-called &lt;a href=&quot;#ombuds&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;conflict coaches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; who can help in the case of personal conflicts at work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a brief description of the kinds of conflict situations where the sign can stand alone without the use of the webpage. This text also highlights that their &lt;a href=&quot;#ombuds&quot;&gt;ombudsperson&lt;/a&gt; provides &lt;em&gt;confidential advice and assistance&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;does not answer to anyone else (in particular not to the Institute’s directors)&lt;/em&gt; and that their &lt;a href=&quot;#ombuds&quot;&gt;conflict coaches&lt;/a&gt; will &lt;em&gt;only take action if you explicitly ask them to do so&lt;/em&gt;. This lowers that barrier that could otherwise prevent people from reaching out for support and help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/equality/draft.svg&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simply the most elegant solution to this information problem I have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The placement of these posters are also brilliant. If you are in need of help, you might be less likely to stop in front of a public bulletin board and read this kind of notice, especially if there are other people around. If you are crying or otherwise in distress, the bathroom might be the only place where you can lock yourself in and be alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this placement of these sign also works as a daily reminder of how to obtain help, even if you do not need it at this very moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;bilingual-emailssignsinformation&quot;&gt;Bilingual emails/signs/information&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;bilingual&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make it a practice to communicate &lt;em&gt;BOTH&lt;/em&gt; in the local main language and in English&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your workspace is not located within a country where English is the main, national language or in a bi/multilingual country, the staff probably communicates using two or more main languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all institutes I have been at, the technical/administrative staff primarily uses the local language (Danish/German/Italian/…),
whereas the academic staff uses English as their primary language of communication. The language requirements when hiring are simply different for different positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This then means that if an email is written either just in the local language or just in English, then a rather large fraction of the total staff will not fully understand it or at the very least will need to do a bit of work to get the message.
This is discouraging, makes it easier for a message to be unread or overlooked, and it sends an indirect message that you as a non-native or non-English speaker are not welcome at the workspace. Still, this has been the practice at most institutes I have had an office space at.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this day and age, a plethora of translation services exists and the receiver of such an email can translate the message into a language they understand.
However, in my opinion, the work of translation should be on &lt;em&gt;the sender&lt;/em&gt; and not on &lt;em&gt;the receiver&lt;/em&gt;.
It should be on the sender to communicate a clear, concise message and not the receiver to properly decipher it.&lt;br /&gt;
It is in the sender’s best interest that the greatest number of people as possible read and understand the message. Sending the message in languages everyone understands also sends an indirect signal that you are welcome at the workspace and that you are a part of the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In practice, this practice can be implemented by making it a workplace-wide policy that all &lt;em&gt;staff-all&lt;/em&gt; communication must happen in both languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All emails on &lt;em&gt;staff-all&lt;/em&gt; email lists/channels should be written in both the local main language and in English. Even just simply writing &lt;em&gt;[English below]&lt;/em&gt; and then appending the machine-translated message outputted by &lt;a href=&quot;https://translate.google.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Google Translate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deepl.com/translator&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;DeepL&lt;/a&gt; makes the overall message more accessible to all and does not take a lot of extra effort by the sender.&lt;br /&gt;
In mathematical terms, the sender spends &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; time to do the translation, while in the case of no translated message then &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; workers each need to do &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; time to translate, so doing it this way overall saves working hours as &lt;em&gt;X &amp;lt; X x Y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(assuming &lt;em&gt;Y&amp;gt;1&lt;/em&gt;; the case of &lt;em&gt;Y=0&lt;/em&gt; is not really communication but just writing notes for yourself, and in the case of &lt;em&gt;Y=1&lt;/em&gt; it would just be rather rude to write a message to a specific person in a language they didn’t understand, wouldn’t it?).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All official signs/notes should also be written in both languages. Even just paper signs like &lt;em&gt;Offices in this hallway will have their windows cleaned Wednesday this week, so please clear the space close to the windows&lt;/em&gt; should be translated, especially as in the example when they request an action from the receiver.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All meetings with information to &lt;em&gt;all staff&lt;/em&gt; must either convey the information in both languages or happen twice: once in the local main language and once in English.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing the practice of bilingual communication for all written communication is rather straightforward to do, as the task of communicating in writing to all staff members is typically picked up by only a few staff members, who can then set a good example to anyone who only infrequently sends emails to all staff members.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this idea also opens up the discussion of how to be a better multi-language workplace. Maybe there are other easy goals easily within reach that would improve the environment for a large fraction of the employees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;review-the-code-of-conduct&quot;&gt;Review the Code of Conduct&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;coc&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implement an official Code of Conduct&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Code of Conduct is a written set of rules, laying out the organisation’s mission along with the moral and ethical expectations of its employees and third parties interacting with the organisation.&lt;br /&gt;
It formulates the values and principles that must be shared among the employees, at all levels, and it affirms that the activities of the organisation are founded on and cherish these values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my experience, many people’s first reactions to Code of Conducts are: &lt;em&gt;Why should we have one? They are so trivial and do not say anything we did not know before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, a Code of Conduct formulates what is right and wrong, meaning that a breach of the obligations of the Codes can have more severe consequences than if the rules were just assumed.&lt;br /&gt;
Just writing down that &lt;em&gt;harassment in any form because of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, physical ability, physical appearance, ethnicity, race, national origin, political aliation, age, religion or any other reason is prohibited&lt;/em&gt; can affect the outcome in more “grey” cases where some leaders might not think to discipline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some workspaces already have Code of Conducts policies in place but, again, check and see if it protects against harassment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find help on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ganintegrity.com/compliance-glossary/code-of-conduct/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;what a Code of Conduct should include&lt;/a&gt; on the internet, but you can also start by having a look at Codes of Conducts of other workplaces.
Today, many communities have formulated their sets of Code of Conduct’s and made them publicly available, so it is rather easy to find inspiration in order to formulate your own set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;organise-and-inform&quot;&gt;Organise and inform&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p id=&quot;organise&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start the work for taking the &lt;em&gt;expensive&lt;/em&gt; steps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, there are many important initiatives to implement in order to really improve equality at a workspace.
This work needs to start somewhere. This work starts with discussions, planning, and brainstorming, and furthermore with applying the pressure to &lt;em&gt;do the right thing&lt;/em&gt; to the right people, typically higher up in the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last first step is this: Organise and establish communities for discussions and actions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be &lt;em&gt;“Equality committees”&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;“Interest groups of Equality at the Workspace”&lt;/em&gt; or similar fora to generally discuss and problem-solve equality issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the approval to be an official body of your workspace (or not: be an informal lobby group).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send around an email about the initiative and an invitation for a founding meeting so people can get engaged. Get the discussion of better equality at your workplace rolling!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to be the first one to start the discussion, but it is important work. Honestly, I have been surprised to find allies in places where I didn’t expect them and it only gets easier when you are organised and people know how to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps might be low-cost, but none of them are completely free.&lt;br /&gt;
Still, I hope this list can provide some inspiration and some overview for where to start making changes, even if you are not in a position of power at your workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These steps will not fix inequality issues overnight but I would argue that an organisation that has implemented the steps above is in a better place to tackle the harder issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Good luck to all of you!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/k1BneeJTDcU&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mountains of content, some better, some worse.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a ongoing list of nuggests that I like/love/recommend that everyone checks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last update: 20/03/2022&lt;/p&gt;

 For years, I have heard about the Finkbeiner test – a simple test on how to write about scientists without redirecting the focus from their science to gender issues in the field. Just recently I discovered the origin of the Finkbeiner test. Highly recommend reading her opinions on the matter.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Honestly, this is one of most inspiring reads I have ever stumbled across. Professor Nagpal tells honestly about her approach to academia, co-parenting, and work/life balance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

This video essay goes into depth with the recent controversies of J. K. Rowling and how harmful they are to the trans-community. It is a polite, funny, in-depth work that explains a lot from the specific J. K. Rowling situation to the more general trans-exclusionary radical feminist’s point of view. For &lt;del&gt;a Potterhead like&lt;/del&gt; me, this is one of the best descriptions of the important topic and it put into words some observations I also have had in feminists communitites and events.&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Working during a pandemic</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;working-during-a-pandemic&quot;&gt;Working during a pandemic&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like everybody else, quarantine has forced me to learn how to hold and participate in good and productive video meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here I am sharing what I have learned so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;few-basic-rules-of-safe-use-of-video-chats&quot;&gt;Few basic rules of safe use of video chats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Share the meeting number only with the participants of your (zoom) meeting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a meeting password.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As a meeting organizer, keep an eye on the dialed-in participants.
  React immediately if an uninvited participant appears.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not transfer files via the video conference system.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Behave in chats in such a way that the information could also become public.&lt;br /&gt;Even in the &lt;em&gt;private&lt;/em&gt; chat between you and one other meeting attendee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like always: &lt;em&gt;Do not click on “Funny Links”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A recording of the video conference requires the explicit consent of all participants.&lt;br /&gt;
Make it clear in the meeting invitation if you plan to record the meeting and ask for consent beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-meeting-etiquette&quot;&gt;Video Meeting Etiquette&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mute your microphone when you’re not talking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to be in a well-lit space with little or no background noise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you want to ask a question, use the &lt;em&gt;raise hand&lt;/em&gt; button in zoom to notify the chairperson.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The chairperson controls the discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
  The chairperson allows participants to talk when it will be the least disruptive to the presentation or discussion.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The chairperson should make it clear if it is best practice to have the cameras turned on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is less than 20 or so attending the meeting, consider asking attendees to keep their cameras on if possible. It allows the discussion to be more natural.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the meeting is more of a seminar or talk with a larger audience, consider asking the attendees to turn off their cameras when they are not speaking in order to save bandwidth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What to do when your flight is delayed (...or cancelled)</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-to-do-when-your-flight-is-delayed-or-cancelled&quot;&gt;What to do when your flight is delayed (…or cancelled)&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/11/12/travel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;travel hacks post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that I have had some experience being delayed or stranding in an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought that the topic deserved it’s own post, so here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-to-do&quot;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;enter-the-queue-to-get-new-tickets&quot;&gt;Enter the queue to get new tickets!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First things first, if your flight is delayed or cancelled, &lt;em&gt;contact your carrier immediately&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
They can rebook you and/or compensate your ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since you probably are not the only one in this situation, then the earlier you enter the queue, the better.&lt;br /&gt;
Consider being in the phone queue while being in the physical queue at the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that &lt;em&gt;within Europe&lt;/em&gt;, they have to get you food coupons and/or get you to a hotel and cover the transport to the hotel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-where-you-want-to-end-up&quot;&gt;Get where you want to end up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do some research in the queue: can you find a replacement flight to your destination, alternatively by a different airline?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure out what the second-closest airport to your destination is.&lt;br /&gt;
Are there any connecting flights that could get you there and minimize your delay to your destination?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe your airline can rebook you – sometimes you will be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be polite – it is (most likely) not whoever you are talking to’s fault that you got delayed&lt;br /&gt;
However, don’t be a pushover! Do not accept anything that they offer you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;living-in-a-airport-when-your-flight-is-delayed&quot;&gt;Living in a airport when your flight is delayed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your flight is not the only one delayed, strongly consider getting to your destination by other means, i.e. trains or buses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When many flights get delayed it can have this cascade effect which is very unpleasant.
It easily means that you need to stand in lines for hours or days without getting a ticket to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have spend an entire weekend in Frankfurt Airport standing in lines and waiting around, getting nothing but increasingly frustrated..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that case, the people from the airlines went through the lines and picked out people with special needs, i.e. travelling with kids or with disabilities, to put them in a higher prioritised line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I was waiting for multiple days and many long hours, waiting unknownly if I could come on the next plane home and I should just have gotten a train or FlixBus or something else to get out of the messy situation.It is a more expensive option, but keep it in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;okay-you-have-now-new-tickets-what-now&quot;&gt;Okay, you have now new tickets, what now?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-spend-your-time-in-an-airport&quot;&gt;How to spend your time in an airport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you suddenly have a surplus of time to spend at an airport, here are some of my tips for how to spend / have fun in an airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Keep updated with where and when your flight will be boarded.&lt;br /&gt; Are you at the right gate and the right terminal?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go explore. Look at book shops or electronics vendors – you do not have to buy anything but it can be interesting to see what new books/electronics are on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Listen to podcasts. I prefer pyodcasts or audiobooks over music when travelling, and at this point there is a podcast about nearly everything. Try out a new podcast: I can recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hellointernet.fm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hello Internet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://becauselanguage.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Because Language&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dungeonsanddaddies.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Daddies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have a physical relax. Find a chair and just sit and save your energy for the journey ahead. Maybe go have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2019/11/12/travel/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some noise-cancelling head phones&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are you travelling with kids? Consider playing a game like  &lt;a href=&quot;https://aerosavvy.com/airport-bingo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;airport bingo&lt;/a&gt; to keep the spirit up. Look for some fun food or other new experiences you can have while at the airport – treat it not as a commute but as an adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to freeze less working at an office</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-to-freeze-less-working-at-an-office&quot;&gt;How to freeze less working at an office&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I freeze easily. I don’t really know why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be because it is just cold where I live.&lt;br /&gt;
…Or that the thermostat is fixed at a too low room temperature.&lt;br /&gt;
…Or it could be because women’s clothing are made so thin and light and are not designed to keep the wearer warm.&lt;br /&gt;
…Or because &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00023.2004&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;women typically produce less body heat than men&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they are more likely to feel chilled or freeze indoor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;del&gt;…Or it could be me as an individual having an abnormal metabolism. (&lt;em&gt;I have been to the doctor – my numbers look fine.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter what, the fact is that I freeze easily and it affect me when I am working.&lt;br /&gt;
When you are freezing your fingers, it is pretty difficult to type on a keyboard and do the kind of office work that I do.
The feeling of freezing in general &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0216362&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;can be very damaging for your overall productivity.&lt;/a&gt;. So this is really a problem worth solving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want my solution to not only to solve my temperature problem but ideally also not cause any other problem or hinder to my work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to be obscured. Too many layers and blankets harm my movement and can be a hassle if I need to get up to go to a meeting / out during a fire drill / go get a cup of tea / do anything else than just sit at my desk
Maybe I am being overly picky, but ideally I also do not want to look like the Office Yeti, shrouded in blankets and winter-outerwear from top to toe.
So how do I solve my issue of feeling cold without &lt;a href=&quot;https://tenor.com/view/friends-matt-le-blanc-joey-tribbiani-could-ibe-wearing-any-more-clothes-gif-4762889&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wearing my entire wardrobe at once&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of things I have tried so far – some of which might be very trivial to you, dear reader.
I have divided the list into what I found to work and what did not work for me (or simply was not to be worth it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two amazing benefits to hot beverages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by drinking them they heat you up from the inside, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;by placing your hands on the outside of your warm mug, you can use it as a finger heater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find a good big, sturdy ceramic mug to use as a finger heater and keep a good selection of your favourite hot beverages in your office space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t really matter if the cup contains coffee, tea, hot cocoa, or simply boiled water – you can use whatever you like the most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially in winter when I (surprise, surprise) freeze the most, I feel how the daily number of hot drinks is inversely proportional to the number of shivers I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that in order not to overindulge on caffeine I prefer to drink low-caffeine tea in winter.
Herbal tea is my go-to choice, but a white Earl Grey or a Jasmine green tea is a nice alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;protect-the-extremities&quot;&gt;Protect the extremities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blood flow to the tips of the fingers and toes tend to shut off more readily when it is cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is apparently especially true for women as they &lt;a href=&quot;https://doi.org/10.1097/00075197-200111000-00012&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;distribute their body heat differently that men&lt;/a&gt;,  with the body heat being centralised around the vital organs instead of heatings the outer parts of the body such as hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like to wear computer gloves. These are gloves I wear inside and they are different from outside gloves as they need to be thin and tight-fitting, so I can type on a keyboard without slipping around or mistyping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still searching for the perfect pair of computer gloves. So far, I use either my normal running gloves&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/runninggloves.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Running gloves: not that discreet and a bit too thick of a material.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or a hoodie with a thumb hole or fingerless-gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/halfgloves.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerless-gloves (or thumb holes) are a part of a few of my hoodies and are nice but they fail to keep the coldest part of my body warm: my fingers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to wear good socks and to keep extra socks at the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sounds trivial, but it works. Buy good, high-rising socks of a nice quality and lots of them.
For extra cold days, wear woolen, knitted socks on top of your normal socks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also like to keep extra pairs of socks at my office, for extra cold days and in case of weather-related emergencies.
It is difficult to keep warm if you are wearing wet clothes. If it it snows or rains and your shoes and socks get wet on your way to work, it saves the day to have something nice and dry to change into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;wraps-wraps-and-more-wraps&quot;&gt;Wraps, wraps, and more wraps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned already that I do not like to be draped in a multitude of fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is nice to have different options to keep warm when you are feeling cold in the varying degrees from chilled to freezing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A scarf can be worn normally or as a small blanket or shawl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/scarf.png&quot; class=&quot;responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A scarf does not take up a lot of space and is super convenient.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding layers is a different way of keeping warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually have both a cardigan and a hoodie (with a thumb hole) at my desk to put on if I am feeling a little cold.
I have both so I can decide which one I want to wear based on the rest of my outfit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/cardigan.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go for a cardigan in a good material such as this one made from&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is even colder, I also have a fleece blanket in one of my office drawers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is bright orange, and not that discreet, but it is nice for the winter days where I will be sitting at my desk all day without a lot of meetings or teaching to attend to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/blanket.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A blanket is also amazing in the late afternoons / evenings / weekeend at the office, where the heating for some reason seems to be turned off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the more extreme winter days, these things can be combined on the cost of turning you into the mystical Office Yeti. The Office Yeti which looks abominable but feels warm and comfortable (and less and less able to move). Again, not ideal, but better than getting nothing done I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can wear the sweater and use the long cardigan as a blanket by binding the arms together around your waist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not have a blanket or a extra cardigan, you can use your coat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;electric-seat-warmers&quot;&gt;Electric seat-warmers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I boroughed one and used one a couple of times in my home office (which is less cold than my office).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/seatwarmer.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall, I can see a similar product might working for me, especially on the very cold winter days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cord was a bit short, the heating very localised, and you need to turn it off for an extended period of time to prevent overheating.
I can see a different, similar product working for me, but I have yet to find what I am looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-does-not-work-for-me&quot;&gt;What does not work for me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reuseable-heat-packs&quot;&gt;Reuseable heat packs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These work alright, but are a bit of a hassle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/heatpack.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They warm your fingers for at most half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to reset them, you need to boil them and let them cool (and remember to do so before you need to use them again).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the same heating effect (and less extra work) from enjoying a warm cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;exercise&quot;&gt;Exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people say that by increasing your daily exercise you also increase your body temperature and thus you should freeze less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not found this to be true for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, when I am out for a run I do feel warmer, but for the remainder of my day I still feel cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the effect is too small for me to feel or maybe I just have not increased my daily exercise pattern enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;finger-exercises&quot;&gt;Finger exercises&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have advised my to do targeted exercises aimed at the body parts I freeze the most: my fingers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the heating from these exercises to disappear almost immediately after I stop doing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, I cannot get any work done while I am stretching, lifting or pressing my fingers to keep them warm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;usb-heating-gloves&quot;&gt;USB heating gloves&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These heaters usually have no stopping criteria and will burn your hands!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/freezing/usb.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A burning power output that is not great for neither your hand, your economy, nor the environment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are a fire hazard and they make a small, high-pitched humming noise that is distracting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So the noise alone is too annoying for me to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;..and you need to be plugged in to your computer for these to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.. and being burned is not a better alternative to being cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;so-in-summary&quot;&gt;So in summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep the following items at my office desk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 big ceramic tea cup&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A well-stocked cabinet of teas and coffees.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A woolen cardigan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A hoodie with thumb hole&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An emergency fleece blanket&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extra woolen socks and extra pairs of normal socks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
