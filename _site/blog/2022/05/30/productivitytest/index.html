<p>During the pandemic, I</p>

<p>I have done this kind of challenge a couple of times before, not always with good results. But I typically learn something and things go in the right direction.</p>

<p>Here is what I want to try:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get up earlier
Since I move to Italy I have been living alone and many of my normal things that usually get me up early have not been working.
My boyfriend is not here to start the morning with, I do not feel safe going on morning runs in the parc (even though I love running in the morning) and an increasing feeling of angst and stress just makes me stay in bed for way longer than what is practical.</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to get up at 6. Have a quick shower, get dressed, grap my bag and get going with breakfast in hand. I have a 45 minute commute by foot and with a podcast it is actually okay.</p>

<p>In order for this to work I need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Go to bed earlier. If I want 8 hours of sleep (and it takes me 30-60 minutes to go to sleep) this means I need to be in bed by between 21:00 and 21:30.</li>
  <li>Pack my lunch the evening before. This means that I at 20:30 the night before need to start packing a lunch and snacks.</li>
  <li>Get an easier breakfast. Currently I have been drinking smoothies in the morning, but maybe I should switch this out to an oatmeal or a chia pudding to eat in the office</li>
</ul>
