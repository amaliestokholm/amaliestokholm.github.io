# Week 10
I felt mentally off in the beginning of the week, rather high anxiety for no apparent reason. I think I need to prioritise some downtime and relaxing this week - it might be a new stress sign?

## Summary
`Project asterism`: I added the KBC surface correction and finished emu tests.

`PLATO`: I got some progress done, but I am not done done.

`Teaching`:
- I am teaching Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.
- I supervised ~1 hour Tuesday and Friday. 

`Postdoc rep`:
- I had the Physics Postdoc Jamboree Monday. It went okay. People liked the concept.
I was pressed on time and I do not think it went perfectly, but it went okay.
I highly appreciated the help from Anjali and Emily.

`Admin`:
- I had a first look on some travel.
