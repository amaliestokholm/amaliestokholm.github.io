# Week 43
Beautiful fall-vibes on campus.

## Summary
`Project asterism`: We are going through how to design the prior for the MLM. It is progressing. I was playing around with emu/hare and hounds set-up, but I am not done.

`Project Emma's catalogue`: I need to send my comments - submission next week.

`Project Rogue and Hennes`: Submission will be November 15. I am trying to figure out why Rogue has tension between it's age, kinematics and spectroscopy.


`Admin`:
- We had postdoc coffee Monday. It happened and people seemed to have fun, but I am not satisfied with the outcome. It is possible my feeling of the event is tainted by feeling stress and confusion all Monday.

### Key things
- I spent most of my time this week coding, debugging and in meetings. Writing this, I feel confused that I have not done more - it is possible I am forgetting what I have done this week.

### Challenges for next week
- I feel like I am juggling too many things at the moment, which is the easiest way to be overwhelmed and stressed. I will spend my Monday closing things so I can focus and have fun.
