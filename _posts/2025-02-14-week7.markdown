# Week 7
It is going to be okay.

---
## Summary
`Project asterism`: I am testing another parameterisation of the scatter around the linear helium enrichment law.
I am taking two steps back: I moved the additions I made last week and I am now testing a model in which the scatter is parameterised using alpha/beta computed from a scaling factor t and the mean from the law.
I am awaiting the last test.

`PLATO`: I am ready to work with the delivery from PSM.
I did work on module 11 and got far. I had questions to the general structure, which I forwarded to the Slack channel. I am awaiting reply.

`Teaching`:
- I am teaching Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.
- I supervised ~1 hour Tuesday and another Friday.

`Postdoc rep`:
- None this week

`Admin`:
I helped:
- two different people with their respective referee report.
- one person with a public interview.

`Other`:
- I do not recall. I did things this week, but right now I do not recall.

### Key things
- I need to be better to write my daily notes.
- Work on asterism is continuing, but hard.
- PLATO work got a deadline (March) so I need to prioritise getting them done.

### Challenges for next week
- asterism
