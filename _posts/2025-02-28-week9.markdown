# Week 9
This week has been fine for me. I have been busy but I have got a lot of small things sorted.
I was travelling Friday, so I did not work that day.

I am ready to next week.

---
## Summary
`Project asterism`: I have added a bunch of tests and plots.
I am more or less done with testing the model on emus - I need to output from one last test.
Then a 'quick' hares test, surface correction and then real data.

`PLATO`: I need to prioritise this next week

`Beyblade`: I solved my VPN, server access and reading/writing access so I moved some structure models from `barbie` to my local machine to be played with. 

`Teaching`:
- I am teaching Tuesday and Thursday afternoon.
- I supervised ~1 hour Tuesday and Friday. Furthermore, one student had their seminar Thursday, so I spend 11-13:30 on seminars.

`Postdoc rep`:
- Prep for Jamboree Monday

`Admin`:
- I gave another git tutorial this week.
- I helped with a referee report.
