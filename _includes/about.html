					Hi! My name is Amalie and I am a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics.
					My primary scientific interest is <i>Galactic archaeology</i> where we learn about the history and evolution of our own galaxy - the Milky Way - by studying the demographics of its stars.<br><br>


					I am current part of the <a href="https://erc.easme-web.eu/?p=804752" target="_blank">CartographY</a> at <a href="https://birmingham.ac.uk" target="_blank">University of Birmingham</a>. Here I am working on the use of stellar inference in many different contexts -- especially stellar inference on populations of stars and where we combine the orbits and chemical compositions of stars with ages derived from the study of stellar pulsations known as asteroseismology. The interplay between these observations allows us to make detailed studies of the Milky Way.<br><br>

					Previously, I was a research fellow <a href="asterochronometry.eu" target="_blank">Asterochronometry group</a> at <a href="unibo.it" target="_blank">Universit√† di Bologna</a> in Bologna, Italy. I did my PhD at the <a href="isimba.dk" target="_blank">iSIMBA group</a> at the <a href="https://sac.phys.au.dk" target="_blank">Stellar Astrophysics Centre</a> at <a href="https://au.dk" target="_blank">Aarhus University</a>, Denmark. I am also part of the developement team of <a href="github.com/BASTAcode/BASTA" target="_blank">BAyesian STellar Algorithm (BASTA)</a>, which is a flexible pipeline for the inference of stellar properties, such as the masses, radii, and ages of stars.<br><br>

					When I am not studying stars, I enjoy running, playing chess, geeking out over musicals, and puzzling with minor coding projects.
					Currently, I am working on the litterature puzzle known as Cain's Jawbone, which is taking up most of my spare time. If you are also struggling with the references to Kipling, Wilde, and Sherlock Holmes, and the many Henrys, feel free to write me.<br><br>
